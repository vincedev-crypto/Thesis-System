## Answer Extraction

The system automatically extracts answers from these patterns:
- `Answer: [correct answer]`
- `Correct: [correct answer]`
- Case-insensitive matching

Examples:

### Column Descriptions (Multiple-Choice Formats):
- **Question**: The question text
- **ChoiceA**: First answer choice
- **ChoiceB**: Second answer choice
- **ChoiceC**: Third answer choice
- **ChoiceD**: Fourth answer choice
- **Answer**: The correct answer (must match one of the choices exactly)

### Column Descriptions (Open-Ended Format):
- **Question_Number**: Sequential question number
- **Difficulty**: Easy, Medium, or Hard
- **Question_Text**: The open-ended question
- **Correct_Answer**: The expected answer (in separate answer key file)

### Important Notes:
- Use quotes around text that contains commas
- The Answer can be in a separate column OR embedded in the question text
- All formats are automatically detected
- First row can be a header (will be auto-detected and skipped)
- System extracts and removes "Answer: ..." from question text automatically
- **Open-ended format requires BOTH files**: questions + answer key

---

## Option 2: Separate Answer Key CSV

If you're uploading a separate answer key CSV, use one of these formats:

### Format A: Question Number with Answer
```csv
QuestionNumber,Answer
1,"Paris"
2,"4"
3,"Mercury"
```

### Format B: Just Answers (line by line)
```csv
Paris

```

In Format B, the first line is answer to question 1, second line is answer to question 2, etc.
